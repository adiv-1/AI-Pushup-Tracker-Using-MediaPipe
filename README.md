# AI-Pushup-Tracker-Using-MediaPipe-Pose-Estimator

### Developed an AI Pose Tracker using Mediapipe and OpenCV to track body landmarks and count pushups in real-time via webcam

Adapted from Nicholas Renotte's "AI Pose Estimation with Python and MediaPipe | Plus AI Gym Tracker" tutorial, this project introduced me to computer vision concepts. I used MediaPipe for pose estimation and OpenCV for video processing. The customized the approach tracked pushups counts by analyzing angle changes between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, displaying real-time feedback on the number of pushups completed and current exercise stage. This adaptation effectively utilizes pose estimation techniques for personalized fitness tracking.. This adaptation allowed for monitoring and analysis of exercise form and count.
